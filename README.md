# LLM-GPT
Building a custom Large Language Model (LLM) using transformer architectures to explore NLP tasks like text generation and summarization. This project showcases advanced AI techniques, serves as a foundation for experimentation, and contributes to open-source innovation.
# My LLM Project ðŸš€

## Overview
This project is my first step into building a Large Language Model (LLM) and a GPT-like architecture. The goal is to explore the foundational concepts of LLMs, experiment with transformer models, and build something impactful while polishing my profile.

## Features
- Customizable transformer architecture
- Fine-tuning on domain-specific datasets
- Example use cases: text generation, summarization, and more
